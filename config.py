# Set to "True" if you want to exclude the background, and "False" if you want to keep it.
# What this mean in practice is if you have an image like the saturn provided one, and you include the background,
# then a lot of patterns will be generated for the black background. For that type of image I rather exclude it,
# so I set it to true.

# For images that don't have a background, and you want the entire image to generate patterns, then set this to False

# This value determines how many prominent colors should be extracted from the original image and used for the
# generation.

# For example, say you want to use 4 different filaments, and you also want to exclude the background. then setting
# the amount to 5 would make sense (as we will scrap the background color anyway, resulting in 4 total used colors).

# If you instead had wanted to include the background then setting 4 would make sense as we're not scrapping a color.

# These values are the ones you want to change to increase/decrease the resolution of the grid.

# You'll have to play with these values a bit depending on the size of your uploaded image.
# If it's a landscape image, keeping both the width and height more or less the same would make sense.
# If it's portrait or other aspects, you'll have to play around to make the image fit to the grid.

# Once you think the aspect ratio is right, you can start multiplying or increasing/decreasing the values depending
# on how large you want the entire panel.

# ex. 15 x 15 works for my landscape image, but I'd like to make it twice as big, I then set it to 30 x 30.
# this will mean it will have the same aspect ratio, but the size and resolution will improve.

# You'll have to estimate the size of the actual print yourself by counting triangles and measuring what your triangle
# size would be with your own prints.
